# FAQ

This list contains a list of common questions and their answers

## Why doesn't Basil work without JavaScript?
Javascript is used to process schedules and determine wether to open a link(s) or load a fallback schedule. JavaScript is therefore required to use Basil.

## I have multiple links specified for a certain item but only a few open. What is happening?
Your browser may be detecting multiple rapidly opening links as annoying pop-ups and blocking them. You can go to your browsers settings and add an exemption for Basil to fix this.
